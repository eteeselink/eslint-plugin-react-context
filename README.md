ESlint plugin that allows checking contextType just like https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react checks propTypes.


Forked from the above-mentioned project because I'm lazy.


I really should just contribute this back to eslint-plugin-react but it's 99% code-duplication with their prop-types rule so we'd need to fix that first. One day!
